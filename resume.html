                <h2>Blackbaud</h2>
                    <h2><span>Senior Production Service Engineer - <strong>April 2022 - Present</strong></span></h2>
                    <p>As a Production Service Engineer at Blackbaud, my day to day consists of
                    managing the Windows, VMware and UCS infrastructure across multiple data centers.
                    I work alongside an awesome team of engineers collaborating to upgrade,
                    update and optimize virtual infrastructure and compute hardware. With the
                    Platform Engineering team we have worked together to upgrade UCS servers and
                    infrastructure and keep the virtualization platform up to date and running
                    optimally for other engineering teams. I also assist team members in
                    managing Active Directory infrastructure and Windows clustering services.
                    Another critical role I help with is assisting with security remediation through
                    audit cycles. Throughout the core data center and Active Directory work my
                    goal is to automate as much as I can using PowerShell scripting. In addition to
                    working in the data center, I also serve the team as an additional scrum master
                    helping to manage the intake and tracking of work using Azure DevOps.
                    Within the team I regularly help facilitate standups, retro and other scrum
                    ceremonies.</p>

                    <p>As the Senior System Administrator at YVC I was responsible for the
                    technical design, planning, implementation, performance tuning and
                    recovery procedures for all college servers and network systems. This
                    role required me to use my technical expertise in the design, upgrading
                    and troubleshooting of complex systems and networks. My role involved
                    management, implementation and supervision of configuration and installation
                    of operating systems, services, and applications.</p>

                    <p>As the IT Manager at Allan Bros Fruit, I was responsible for the day-to-day IT
                    operations and systems availability for warehouse and business operations.
                    I managed a team of IT operations technicians and developers to ensure
                    smooth and functional access to business and packing line systems and data.
                    In my role I ensured projects were being led to completion successfully. I
                    worked with groups like shipping, production, and field operations to ensure
                    their IT needs were being met.

                                    <p>
                    As the System Administrator at Allan Bros Fruit, I managed the IT servers
                    and network to maintain uptime and availability throughout the warehouse
                    and packing line operations. One of my first major projects was upgrading
                    all server hardware and virtualization software and replacing it with new high-end server hardware and storage. The project allowed for a 75%
                    improvement in performance and allowed for a fully replicated DR site to
                    be procured and installed. Additionally, failover and backup services were
                    deployed using Veeam Backup and Replication. My role also included security
                    awareness and training where we implemented KnowBe4 phishing testing and
                    training software.
